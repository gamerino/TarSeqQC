Title: TARgeted SEQuencing Experiment Quality Control
Author: Gabriela A. Merino, Cristobal Fresno and Elmer A. Fernandez
Maintainer: Gabriela Merino <gmerino@bdmg.com.ar>
Description: The package allows the representation of targeted
        experiment in R. This is based on current packages and
        incorporates functions to do a quality control over this kind
        of experiments and a fast exploration of the sequenced regions.
        An xlsx file is generated as output.
