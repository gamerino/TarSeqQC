Changes in version 1.4.1
CODE
    * Fix error of duplicated parameter in plotRegion function
    * Changes in TargetExperiment contstructor to avoid errors related
    to unmapped reads in the alignment BAM files
    * The checkBedFasta function was added to perform a control of the 
    Bed and Fasta file consistency
    * Changes in plotRegion methods to allow filter noise SNPs
    * Changes in plotGeneAttrPerFeat method to incorporate the
    exploration of overlapped amplicons
VIGNETTE
    * Troubleshoot explaining the way to exclude unmapped reads with older
    TarSeqQC versions
Changes in version 1.3.13
CODE
    * Modification in readFrequencies method to fix countOverlaps error
    * Modification in plot methods to capitalize axis names and titles
----------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.3.12
CODE
    * Modification in readFrequencies method in order to count only those
    reads falling out the features and non the overlapped.
    * Modification in plotRegion method to correclty plot overlapped features
----------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.3.1
----------------------------------------------------------------
CODE
    * Addition of a new class called TargetExperimentList that allows the 
    the comparisson of several TargetExperiment objects obtained using the 
    same bed file
Changes in version 1.1.6
----------------------------------------------------------------
CODE
    * Changes in summaryIntervals in order to allow the exploration at
    pool levels, useful when a targeted sequencing involving several PCR
    pools was performed.
    * plotAttrPerform method was added. This function produces a ggplot 
    graph illustrating relative and cumulative frequencies of features
    in attribute intervals. If the panel has several pools, then the graph
    shows the mentioned results for each pool.
Changes in version 1.1.2
----------------------------------------------------------------
CODE

    * Changes in buildFeaturePanel in order to reduce the run time. Now, the
    pileupCounts is not called, thus the pileup matrix is not built. Instead 
    it, coverage and others Rsamtools and IRanges methods are used.
    * readPercentages and plotInOutFeatures methods were added in order to
    explore experiment efficiency.
    * biasExploration and plotMetaDataExpl were added in order to perform bias
    sources exploration. The first allows the gc content, feature length or 
    other source distribution exploration. The second implement a plot in which
    attribute distribution for each source bias quartile or group is explored. 

VIGNETTE
    * English correction and new methods incorporation
Changes in version 1.1.1
----------------------------------------------------------------
CODE

    * In setters and initialize functions, examples were updated
    to shorten elapsed times (only interactive). Thanks to V. Obenchain

VIGNETTE
    
    * Elapsed times reduction using TarSeqQC data example instead of 
    building myPanel from scratch. Thanks to V. Obenchain
